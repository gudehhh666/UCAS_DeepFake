> This repository contains our **complete solution** for the *AI Security and Adversarial Competition (Spring ’25)* from TEAM **Donot Push_Us**.  
> The project is split into two independent, but complementary, modules:  
>
> 1. **Deepfake Detection** (🛡️)  
> 2. **Deepfake Generation** (🎭)  
>
> You’ll find a high‑level overview below, together with clear placeholders (`TODO:`) where we’ll later embed the full operational walkthroughs.
